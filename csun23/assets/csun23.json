Now, we have a new tool, the Accessible Usability Scale, to measure the experience of assistive technology users. It's a 10-question survey that will give you a numeric score that you can use to compare and evaluate experiences across different digital products, websites and apps. This adapted version of the System Usability Scale better captures the lived experience of assistive technology users in task-oriented research. \r\n \r\nWith hundreds of AUS results reviewed and synthesized since 2020, Fable researchers have been building a practice of evaluating UX with the AUS as a key tool.

Students have experienced new barriers to learning along with different impacts of previously existing barriers. In this new normal, instructors are continuing to adjust to the challenge of offering more inclusive, accessible, and flexible learning opportunities. To help faculty adjust to these changing times, Northwestern created the Universal Design for Learning Practicum. This practicum, attended by over 300 faculty, focused on practical implementation of the three UDL principles multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement. The topic was one of interest, but the unique structure which weaved together interactive synchronous sessions, asynchronous learning activities, individual consultations, and opportunities to learn with and from peers is what made this a transformational learning experience for faculty.\r\nThe practicum was a collaborative effort of over 60 people and ten different units on campus. This session will lay a roadmap for other higher education institutions to follow to successfully implement UDL/accessibility initiatives. The session will focus on how partnerships were developed and fostered to create the practicum, the planning of both the structure and the content of the practicum, the practicum\u2019s execution, and the results both in faculty learning and the impact it has had on students in classes across campus.\r\n\r\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.

Because most UX designers are only taught about color-contrast and alt-text, keyboard operability is often not designed in, not implemented and not checked (if at all) until the project is near completion. The perceived extra effort for manually checking for good keyboard operability leaves it up to developers to add it on the end of the project life cycle.     \r\n\r\nWe here at IBM have been pioneering new features as part of our open-source IBM Equal Access Accessibly Checker to create novel yet effective user interfaces that will make manual keyboard testing easier, more comprehensive, and less error prone. During this talk we will discuss our state-of-the-art visualization approach to identifying errors with keyboard navigation and operability and why we made some of our design decisions. \r\n\r\nThis talk includes the results of a multi-year project, a user research phase, and iterations on implementation.  We\u2019ll explore the results on how it makes manual keyboard testing faster for auditors, designers as well as developers. And we will demonstrate the new features in our open-source checker.",

    "description": "MD (Macular Degeneration) is caused by changes to the macula, hindering predominantly the central vision which is used when looking straight at something. However, MD does not affect the peripheral vision, and people with MD can perceive the environment to a certain extent, generally  lacking of clarity and detail compared to central vision. This condition is often very disabling in everyday life and it can be very frightening for the person experiencing it.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study was to investigate whether Virtual Reality (VR) technologies with integrated eye-tracking can be used to assess and to train people\u2019s skills to search for objects in space when central vision is degraded. Eye-tracking has not been used with people with visual impairments in VR and as such we are exploring the efficiency of using such measures for future research. For this study, 20 participants (fully sighted and with MD) were recruited and were asked to spatially detect and identify 3D objects within a custom-designed VR space. They were asked to find these objects while continuous real-time eye gaze movement and fixation tracking were enabled together with the tracking of behavioural and verbal responses. Results show a deficit in visual detection and discrimination in people with MD that can be explained by altered visual search patterns as measured by eye tracking. These findings will help us understand visual search deficits in people with MD and provide opportunity for training and education.",

A PDF processor is any software that allows someone to view a PDF, interact with it, and fill in forms, for example. This also includes assistive technologies. There is confusion and inconsistency regarding how PDFs are processed. While commonly used web technologies typically deliver consistent results, the same cannot be said for PDF processors. Results may vary when viewing PDFs in a browser versus viewing them with different desktop applications. In addition, different assistive technologies handle PDFs differently. The goal is to bring together processor and AT developers to discuss current functionality and what can be done differently in accordance with the new PDF specifications to provide better end-user experiences. This session is designed to report on the work that has already been done and to invite\u2014and even inspire\u2014developers providing support for accessibility needs; this includes people who remediate and fix PDFs, developers working on PDF processors that interface with end-users like PDF viewers and web browsers, and Assistive Technology (AT) experts.\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.

Returning to our homes, we wondered if we could continue the energy and curiosity found at a conference, only transforming it for a virtual work environment. \r\n\r\nThe following week,  we launched Intuit\u2019s Zoom-based Accessibility Lunch and Learn series. It was an experiment planned to last only a few weeks. We reached out to our Accessibility Champion network and quickly arranged daily lectures, mostly based on presentations already given at onboarding and other training events. \r\n\r\nAs the epidemic grew, we turned inward and focused less on accessibility and more on our mental health, living with a disability, and celebrating our diversity. \r\n\r\nThe key transformation came with a talk about sobriety in the workplace. The speaker\u2019s courage to discuss her journey led to  heartfelt conversations about mental health, the loss of community, and the struggle where colleagues were trying to encourage hope with \u201chappy hours\u201d and alcohol-related team building activities. This presentation led to immediate improvements in our workplace language and pandemic policies. It also showed a lunch and learn was more than a lecture. It could be the community we were aching for. \r\n\r\nWith more than 100 presentations and thousands of participants, we continue to learn something new every week.",

The print ready file that is generated for traditional print and mail contains all the information required to convert a document to an accessible PDF, HTML, braille, large print, eText or Audio. \r\nPrint ready files like PDF, PostScript, AFP, Xerox, HP contain information that include fonts, text positioning and the critical style sheet.  Using business rules and templates that have logic that programmatically applies tagging information allows for conversion to an accessible PDF and then to an alternate format can be used effectively to make billions of on-line and printed d",

    "description": "Producing accessible PDF documents at an enterprise scale is never easy. More so, the Customer Communication Management (CCM) systems used to create statements, letters, policies, invoices, records, and more require specific expertise to build accessible templates, not always fully supporting complex content. Worse yet, they tend to lack fully integrated, innovative best-practice testing tools to ensure outputs meet ADA and accessibility standards like WCAG and PDF/UA. The result: an untenable ability to remediate the ever-increasing number of existing PDFs and reach a state of relative compliance.\r\n\r\nWe will use Allyant's highly advanced deep neural network AI to show how document generation becomes more intelligent over time. Furthermore, as the solution produces files, the algorithms are continually enhanced through our quality assurance and post-processing methodology. Essentially, the tool is \"taught\" through accessible sample documents how to properly tag PDF documents. This ensures those documents are fully accessible to work seamlessly with screen readers and other assistive technologies.",

HumanWare and DOT Inc answered the call and have since partnered with APH to develop the Dynamic Tactile Device (DTD).  \r\n\r\nAPH is the largest producer of tactile textbooks in the country, however, these textbooks often take months to produce and can arrive late, leaving the student at a further disadvantage when learning. The primary goal of the DTD project is to create a tactile E-Reader capable of displaying a textbook in a natural fashion that mimics the experience a student has when reading a physical textbook. Once produced, this textbook will be digitally sent to the student or teacher, eliminating the significant production time and cost it takes to emboss, bind, pack and ship the book to the student. This E-Textbook reader is just one of several tactile experiences that will be opened up by this innovative tool.  \r\n\r\nAttendees of this session will be introduced to the DTD project, understand the current status of this undertaking and learn how to get involved going forward.

The goal being a highly useable and accessible system which has been facilitated by visual design, not lead by it. Reprioritizing the purpose of a design system: Firstly, to benefit people and secondly, teams that build products. Multidisciplinary collaboration: Adopt a collaboration first approach. Subgroups for each component consist of design, accessibility, engineering, and test to collaborate at all stages of the component creation process. Research and Testing: Include people and make them the primary focus in testing and research. Incorporate Usability, A/B Testing and people journey exploration through personas. Consistency across components: Explore the bigger picture. Contextual testing of components grouped together instead of in silo. Going beyond WCAG: Be groundbreaking instead of minimum accessibility. Challenging historically accepted common patterns: Test patterns and see which work best as not all common patterns are as accessible as they could be.

It also makes it much easier for them to move their settings between the different computer they need to use. This included the built-in accessibility features and any AT that is installed on computers at school, the library, etc. What used to be complicated and require going into and navigating the hierarchical settings panels \u2013 can now be done with a single click \u2013 from the desktop. \r\n\r\n2) Secondly, Morphic allows anyone to create simple, custom MorphicBars for themselves or for family members, friends, or those they care for.  These custom MorphicBars appear down the side of the screen and provide 1-click access to any program, website, or accessibility/usability feature on the computer. \r\nThis is especially helpful to those who struggle with computers or are unable to use them at all. Instead of having to figure out what \"programs\" are, or how to \"launch\" or \"close\" or \"switch\" between them, and or how to navigate \"windows\" that cover each other up, menus that need to be understood etc, \u2013 they can have a single row of buttons down the side of their screen that gives them access to all of the basic programs and functions they need.",

    "description": "Our CVS Health Inclusive Digital Design team believes that including people with disabilities in user research leads to more inclusive, accessible, usable, and generally more delightful experiences for everyone. When it came to designing a horizontally scrolling component as part of our Design System, we wanted to ensure the voices of assistive technology (AT) users were included in our solution. \r\n\r\nA horizontally scrolling component is a way of managing an overflow of related items in a single horizontal flow. From a product perspective, a horizontal scroll (or carousel, or slider) provides more opportunities to engage users by adding content to a section of the screen.  \r\n\r\nHowever, horizontal scrolls are knowingly frustrating obstacles for AT users. Working with the Design System team, we set out to understand accessibility barriers with horizontal scrolls, find ways to mitigate those problems, and identify the best (and worst) contexts to use horizontal scrolls. We interviewed a range of AT users, including screen reader, magnification, voice, and switch users. \r\n\r\nFrom our research, it is clear that there are always better options available. From a user\u2019s perspective, a horizontal scroll hides content, which it can be laborious to discover. Also, AT users generally try to avoid interacting with horizontal scrolls. Ultimately, since horizontal scrolls are likely to remain commonplace, we developed a detailed set of guidelines to minimize the barriers this component can create.",

HRTFs should ideally be personalised and require head tracking to present a persistent virtual world around the user (for sighted gamers the software knows their head is facing the screen). These features are available but are rarely advertised or fully utilised and as such may have much more potential as an accessibility feature then they are currently realising. Research is needed to ascertain the extent to which these features could help. \r\nThis presentation aims to outline the six areas of improvement and what has been done so far to advance these. We will also discuss head tracking and personalised HRTFs and whether research and intervention is needed to ensure these live up to their accessibility potential.",

    "description": "We propose a navigation system that helps a visually impaired person (VIP) get to their desired destination safely and independently, even when it is a place to which the person is not used to going. Currently, VIPs often travel with white canes and guide dogs. With a white cane, it is difficult to determine the presence of a wide range of obstacles. Furthermore, there are VIPs who cannot have a guide dog for various reasons. In either case, it can be difficult to navigate to where the user wants to go.  In addition, visual information is important for maintaining balance in posture. When users have less visual information, it can be difficult to maintain posture. \r\nBased on the above considerations, a navigation system with a light touch contact (LTC) and a drone is proposed. The LTC is a phenomenon in which a small force of approximately 0.2\u20130.5 N is applied to a part of the human body, thereby stabilizing the posture. The system applies the resultant force of the contact force for LTC and the inductive force that tells the user where to go. It was confirmed by experiments using a toy drone that both induction and stabilization of posture could be achieved in able-bodied persons with their eyes closed. The proposed system reduced the walker's vibration observed with linear accelerations. In the future, we expect the system to be embedded in such devices as drones with strings. Sensors are used to recognize the surroundings and current location and guide the user.",

We also have 8 different products to design for. We solve for this by making our design system dynamic, so that certain elements can change while the base component remains the same.\r\n\r\nWhat special accessibility considerations have been made for Intuit?\r\nAccessibility is a part of the design process, and is taken into consideration before implementation has even begun.

It allows you to automatically/systematically convert inaccessible technical parts into various accessible forms such as an image object with an alt text/an audio object (aloud reading) and place them in the PPT slide.  Infty software: \"InftyReader\" (an OCR system for STEM) and \"ChattyInfty\" (an accessible STEM-document editor) carry out the conversion automatically in the background.\r\n\r\nIn case that a math formula is not in PPT, you can create it directly in ChattyInfty (which is easily done in an intuitive manner) and insert that formula into the PPT slide together with alt text or aloud reading generated by ChattyInfty.  Otherwise, you may start with a PDF source; at first, you convert a math formula in PDF into a ChattyInfty form once with InftyReader OCR and then, insert it into PPT. \r\n\r\nIf a lecture script (narration) is prepared in ChattyInfty, you can add the speech presentation generated by ChattyInfty to each slide and convert entire PPT into an accessible MP4 video.",

    "description": "Highcharts is a world leading provider of accessible charting tools for the web, used by 80 of the top 100 Fortune companies. Recently Highcharts and global publishing company Elsevier\u2019s Digital Accessibility Team collaborated to provide better accessibility for line charts with large datasets.\r\n\r\nLine charts are often used to visualize datasets with thousands of data points. This presents a challenge for non-visual access, as providing access to individual data points is not sufficient. A reader of a line chart with a large amount of data will aim to extract information about trends, patterns, and outliers from the chart.\r\n\r\nCan we make this information more accessible by communicating it through text and sound? What is the most intuitive way to experience this data through sound? And to which extent can we automate the text description?\r\n\r\nHuman authored text descriptions of charts are historically difficult to beat, but can in many cases be impractical \u2013 such as where data is dynamically loaded in real-time. Automated text descriptions can also be designed to be more objective and less prone to biases. Will users be able to trust these descriptions? Will they still prefer those created by a human?\r\n\r\nWith each of the new accessibility research questions we will provide user feedback from non-sighted users on our approaches. We will share findings about best practices, and show screen reader demos to help illustrate design considerations.",

The true strength of the conference is the spectrum of conversations that happen in hallways, sessions, tradeshows, and even the late-night bar runs. It's a house filled with global family members who can't wait to share what they've learned.\r\nEveryone that attends a CSUN Conference gains new perspectives, but some sessions and events have a profound impact on your understanding of accessibility and inclusion. Jennison Asuncion and Ted Drake, the 2023 Program Chairs, will share moments that had a profound impact. They will summarize the moment, what they learned, and how they used that information to change their careers. You will be inspired to embrace the CSUN experience, whether it is a profound conversation in a session, a chance meeting in the hallway, chaotic audience participation, or starting a new collaboration over drinks at the bar.",

    "description": "One of the major challenges facing designers is dropping into accessibility and gaining the wisdom of knowing what is good, better, and best design decisions. Applying design thinking approaches to accessibility challenges in designing delightful experiences has yielded an approach to introducing accessibility to designers. Evaluating real-world designs for better accessibility can enlighten designers on how to make better decisions. Practical examples will be a great reference and foundation for designers going forward. \r\n\r\nSome design decisions are good and follow some of the basic guidelines in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), but reading that document feels like a bunch of lawyers are talking to geeks. WCAG is written for front-end developers and subject matter experts, not designers. We found that designers need pictures and sketches of good designs that have been re-designed, and re-sketched to be even better accessible designs. Seeing and participating in the evaluation process is how designers experience the process of making better design decisions. \r\n\r\nMost UX designers are only taught about color contrast, alt-text, and maybe labels.  How to make the best accessible design decisions is not taught in design schools. This fun session will provide a way for designers to not only learn good and better designs but how to even make the best design decisions.\r\n\r\nA large enterprise company like IBM has a variety of real-world use cases.

    "description": "Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires the US Government to buy, build, and implement Information and Communication Technology (ICT) that is accessible to all its employees and members of the public. Since the US Federal Government buys more Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology than it builds in-house, it relies on Industry to understand and implement the Section 508 standards into the products they build. This presentation provides an overview of the Section 508 Technical Standards, discusses the importance of accessibility, and shares information about the Federal acquisition lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThe Federal CIO Council established an Accessibility Community of Practice (ACoP) to promote the adoption of Section 508 across the Federal Government. As leaders of the ACoP Industry Outreach Subcommittee, we will share our stories of Industry engagement. We will define and explain the importance of Accessibility Conformance Reports and roles that Industry and Government customers play in the acquisition of accessible technology. In order to guide Industry towards addressing the Section 508 standards and developing reports on the accessibility of its products, NASA developed a guide to \u201cDemystify Section 508\u201d that will be reviewed.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will conclude with best practices for the development of accessible technology, Accessibility Conformance Reports, and reiterates why building accessible ICT is a \u201cWin-Win\u201d proposal for both Industry and Government.",

Designed for professional development, Braille Brain includes over 40 literary and Nemeth training modules, which are carefully sequenced to promote mastery of the braille code. Each module has a focus area for learning specific braille symbols, followed by several practice activities. The training materials are designed to be incorporated into personnel preparation programs and used in braille courses as supplemental materials. Although modules are carefully sequenced and build upon one another, users also may select specific lessons on demand, providing just in time delivery of the resources. \r\nThe literary UEB modules (n = 66) and Nemeth modules (n = 49) have been pilot tested by pre-service teachers and paraprofessionals. Ratings from user surveys showed overall, 100% of users strongly agreed or agreed on each of six different quality indicators, with more than 75% of users rating their training positively as strongly agree on four of six indicators. \r\nThe project, now in its fourth year has partnered with the American Printing House for the Blind to offer fully accessible online resources which will be available on their website in 2023. Presenters will provide attendees with a sneak preview of the website, explain the scope and sequence of the training materials, and demonstrate Braille Brain activities.",

So why not make it easy and start at the beginning, at the document creation phase?\r\n\r\nOrganizations must guarantee compliance with various accessibility standards or face severe and expensive consequences. Millions of users face the challenge of creating accessible and compliant documents. Historically, making Word documents accessible has required a thorough knowledge of Word functionality, as well as an in-depth understanding of document accessibility. However, most content authors are unfamiliar with accessibility standards and are equally unprepared for the additional time required to make each document compliant. Furthermore, it would cost tremendous amounts of time and money to make every document author an expert in Microsoft Word and accessibility standards. This would seem an incredibly overwhelming and expensive task, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. We will discuss solutions that make the process much easier and more cost-effective.",

    "description": "The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 (WCAG 2.2) is currently in CR but due to be released in December 2022. WCAG 2.2 builds on WCAG 2.1 by adding 9 new success criteria addressing issues for:\r\n\u2022 users with low vision\r\n\u2022 users with cognitive impairments\r\n\u2022 users with mobility issues\r\nSeveral of the new success criteria are considered to just be formalising what many accessibility experts consider best practice and hence advised their teams or clients to do anyway. For example, sufficient touch target size was always considered good advice \u2013 why would you want to design an interactive element that is difficult to activate? Having a requirement that focus indication not only be present but defining what constitutes clearly visible is also a welcome addition to assist low vision users. \r\nThere is lots of work around categorising WCAG success criteria by what role in a development team should be taking responsibility for which criteria. The three design roles often considered when discussing who should take primary responsibility for accessibility are:\r\n\u2022 visual design\r\n\u2022 interaction or UX design\r\n\u2022 content design and preparation\r\nOther roles with implementation responsibility include the developer which we will briefly discuss in this presentation in terms of how the success criteria could be implemented once designers have addressed the criteria.",

Three legal cases of service dog access denial in two hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area. One case, a landmark decision, is the precedent for future service dog access denial cases. The cases created awareness and understanding of service dogs, the tasks they perform, with implications to ensure the rights of service dog recipients. 2. The invention of a therapeutic board game for psychiatric inpatients presents therapists with a tool to increase mental health. The game has interventions to help patients learn about themselves and others. Greater awareness and understanding of each other and their problems creates greater empathy and compassion. 3. Three educational programs teaching students design thinking while inventing something to meet the needs of an individual with a disability are Project Invent, Design the Future, and Stanford University\u2019s, \u201cPerspectives in Assistive Technology.\u201d The students learn about the challenges of an individual with a disability.

Two major transitions occur in one\u2019s life when it comes to education and work: the transition from K12 education to higher ed and from higher ed to the workplace. Technology made available to a learner in the classroom can help facilitate not only access to the curriculum but also necessary support to persist and move through one\u2019s educational career. This technology has been found to be just as critical when individuals move into the workplace. A single tool used continuously throughout all segments of one\u2019s education and work career can be key to more seamless transitions and success. \r\n\r\nThis session will explore the literacy support tool, Read&Write from a lens of use throughout the education and workplace continuum. Attendees will understand the tool as a student begins use in the K12 setting, giving them access to course content and supporting them as they work toward graduation. As students move into higher education, this same tool can be used as they gain skills for the workplace and learn in this more advanced and intensive setting. Finally, within the workplace, students will already have mastery of the tool given the long standing use. Individuals can continue to use Read&Write when making their mark on the working world. By having continuity throughout the lifespan, individuals can be more confident, more successful and spend more time excelling in their programs or work.\r\n\r\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.

This is the case even for those with one or more disabilities. Yet to make products and pages accessible, we need a critical mass of trained designers and developers.\r\nAlthough involving users with disabilities in research and testing helps inform and confirm decisions, to the degree we want to make experiences delightful, we need development teams to have the basics down, so that the focus can turn to innovating towards better designs, not struggling for basic accessibility.\r\nTo date, training and education has focused on text-heavy guidance and implementation examples.\r\nInitial testing with a small set of sample questions suggests that through side-by-side comparisons of designs, we can more rapidly engage users, and make learning accelerated and fun.\r\nThis presentation will expand on initial work done in this field at IBM. Attendees will be offered a chance to participate in real-time polling, and then comment on the results.\r\n\r\nWe will then provide a forum for users to contribute towards an open-source online game for learning accessibility. We will address considerations around how to make a gaming interface accessible. We will also explore some of the challenges of constructing examples of inaccessible design which can yet remain explorable, and seek audience input on how to construct a question bank that welcomes involvement from all users.",

    "description": "When you hear Artificial Intelligence (AI), your mind goes one of two ways: either Sci-Fi, or really complicated technology. We don\u2019t realize it, but AI already plays a big role in our everyday lives. AI influences our lives, sometimes for the better (getting good recommendations on Netflix based on our viewing history, for example) and sometimes, the worse (targeted ads when navigating the Internet).\r\n\r\nAt Humanware, we saw the potential for AI to help in the world of Orientation & Mobility and asked ourselves, how can we use technology to makes the lives easier for our users? The final forty feet was an easy answer. We all know that GPS and maps are never 100% accurate. Sometimes, the GPS will make you stop a door short, or too far from your intended destination. A sighted person can easily confirm if they\u2019re in the right place. But for a blind person, it can lead to knocking on the wrong door.\r\n\r\nHumanWare StellarTrek is the perfect example of AI technology at its best, assisting the user to confirm he or she is at the correct destination by detecting doors and addresses.  GPS coordinates, cameras, Wi-Fi connections are all used in conjunction to return the most accurate information, from confirming the address and doors to OCR results, back to the user.    \r\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s only the beginning! With AI, it opens up the door to a slew of potential features, such as crosswalk detection, currency recognition, and beyond!",

When looking through the camera's viewfinder, a weak laser beam passes through the pupil and projects images that are picked up by the camera directly onto the retina. The projected image is always focus-free, independent of the focusing ability of the eyes. The projected image is clear even in the peripheral area of the retina, which is better than natural vision. Moreover, the optical zooming function of the attached digital camera can provide great magnification to the users.\r\nBy using this device, some people with low vision can dramatically improve their quality of life, since they can watch things better with retinal projection than with their own impaired vision.

Designers do have an inclusive mindset but struggle with knowing how to start, what exactly they should be considering, or how to communicate the accessibility intent to engineers.\r\n\r\nWe created a Figma annotation tool for hand-off to engineers. It makes it easy to check if designs are accessible and helps designers to communicate through accessibility annotations. The plugin gives easy to follow steps that focus designers on considering the experience and increase their confidence about what is expected from a design accessibility spec. At the same time, the output annotations provide engineers the guidance they need for implementation.\r\n\r\nThe session will go through the context of how this project came about and why we chose to build a Figma plugin. There will be a detailed demonstration of how the tool works, outlining its benefits and how it fits into the design process.",

This information could easily be weaponized, turning essential activities into high-risk scenarios.\r\nVoting is a prime example of a high-risk scenario. In-person experiences generally require some amount of sighted assistance with a paper ballot. During the 2020 presidential election a surge in absentee voting, motivated by COVID-19, exposed a further gap in accessibility. Not a single state offers a fully independent absentee ballot for blind and low vision voters. I conducted interviews with 12 blind and low vision voters to better understand their experiences and their approach to the need for human assistance where options for independence are limited. This presentation puts the results in context and proposes user-focused design solutions for absentee voting and similar high-risk privacy scenarios.",

The continued success led to the creation of an annual event. \r\nBuilding on that success, APH and CSB, along with Center for Cybersecurity Research & Education (CCRE) and the Center for Assistive Technology Training (CATT), are planning a Day of Code to be combined with the annual National Coding Symposium.\r\nCoding is fun, challenging, and inherently accessible across platforms and skill levels. Students of every age benefit from learning to code. This symposium aims to inspire students to become leaders in careers inclusive of and related to programming and software development and to provide teachers with the resources and support they need to teach coding concepts with ease.\r\nDuring this session, we will discuss and share: \r\n*Successes and lessons learned from previous Coding Symposiums\r\n*Benefits of learning to code for students who are blind or visually impaired\r\n*Challenges facing students and teachers\r\n*Resources from previous symposiums including lesson plans, activities, and recorded videos for use by teachers and students\r\n*Advantages of making connections with blind programmers and others in careers associated with coding at companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google, Yahoo, etc.\r\n*The plan for Day of Code to be a national event \r\nNo knowledge of coding is needed to benefit.",

How can such teams improve the accessibility of all enterprise content when it seems impossible to even identify everyone who is creating content? Rather than focus at the individual employee level, The Digital Accessibility Team at Kent State University chose to methodically interview the supervisors of content-creating teams to understand their workflows and develop curated but low-maintenance training and new standard operating procedures. When managers become the key point of contact to the Digital Accessibility team, it extends the principle of accessibility being every employee\u2019s responsibility and frees accessibility specialists to focus on higher quality training of fewer people. Through the manager\u2019s involvement, the accessibility information and best practices become team-specific and have immediate application, increasing employee engagement. This process establishes mid-level managers as accessibility advocates, modeling and expecting the inclusion of accessibility practices in all stages of content creation. Kent State\u2019s Digital Accessibility team will show how they provided pre-recorded trainings then coached managers on practice sessions and team standards. This process is universally effective with webmasters, marketers, social media creators, educational/library resource material curators, and digital graphic designers.",

    "description": "Implementing an effective inclusive learning initiative might be a new or unfamiliar process. Creating buy-in from campus leadership, creating faculty awareness, redesigning courses, and tracking progress are just a few of the steps necessary to help drive a cultural shift in how faculty approach accessibility and universal design. How do institutions prioritize their efforts for universal design for learning? What impact does professional development for faculty have on accessible course materials? It is critical for universities to shift to meet the needs of a variety of students. This includes race, social class, ethnicity, cognitive differences, gender, families, and many more. At the university level we should embrace these changes and take steps toward believing that diversity makes us stronger. If we believe that working to make changes, to create pathways for all students to be successful, and to provide rigorous content is important then we must take that step.  UDL is a platform for building that step; for raising people up, expanding opportunity, and creating an environment for divergent thinking. And at its core, this is what a university should be providing its students. For many universities, implementing an effective inclusive learning initiative may be a new or unfamiliar process. Creating buy-in from campus leadership, creating faculty awareness, and tracking progress are just a few of the steps necessary to help drive a cultural shift.\r\n\r\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.

    "description": "Most digital accessibility conversations cover web experiences where a user is navigating through an interface to complete a goal, such as an online shopping experience, email client or a project management tool. Landmarks, headings, and structure guidance from best practices support the discretionary use of these web tools. However, in a nonoffice work setting, like an inventory picker, or packaging orders into boxes, a user follows directions and prompts from the application to execute the manual work. In these cases, the workers performance is often measured on how many items they can pick, or orders they can box. The nature of the human-application interaction is foundationally different than one which is user directed. To make a computer driven application accessible requires extra evaluation on the application and all contributing factors to the overall task begin completed. The surroundings may not be a quiet space and the primary input devices may not be a keyboard or keyboard alternative. \r\n\r\nWhat is possible when accessibility means all workers can perform at the same efficiency?

The central purpose of the study was to explore the use of various digital technological aids for the social inclusion of adolescents with hearing impairment in general society.  A cross-section survey design was followed to gather data from a sample of 85 SWHI (both male and female) from graduate and post-graduate levels and their 50 teachers. Two structured questionnaires were developed; one for SWHI and the other for their teachers. Experts validated the instrument concerning content and construct validity. Cronbach alpha reliability of the instruments was .85. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The study revealed that the use of digital devices has added great value in integrating SWHI in general society. However, the lack of availability of the latest technology has slowed down their inclusion. No significant difference has been found in the use of technology based on gender and academic grade of students. The study recommended the provision of the latest technology and teachers' training to use digital devices for teaching hearing-impaired students.",

    "description": "Aira is committed to helping organizations build a more inclusive workplace. As we continue to innovate and collaborate with both mainstream and assistive technology partners, one thing drives us, and that is access to visual information is a right and as a right, access should be within reach of everyone.\r\n\r\n In July 2022 we introduced Aira Everywhere, addressing the needs of our customers to have access to our professional visual interpreters on a range of devices. The effort began internally with the public beta of our Aira for Desktop solution. Next we released Aira for the Envision  Glasses, returning a hands-free wearable to the market. And then we brought Aira to the Blind Shell Classic 2 phone, providing access for people who prefer tactile buttons rather than a touch screen experience. Our tool is designed for broad applicability, supporting a range of skills, regardless of someone\u2019s  competence with technology.  \r\n\r\nWith access to professional visual interpreters on a range of devices, how do you know what will work for your employees? In this workshop we will highlight use cases from a variety of industries to demonstrate that the answer is fluid and depends on the individual employee. You will learn how Aira is a \u2018ready for work\u2019 productivity tool.\r\n\r\nBy offering Aira\u2019s visual interpreting service, your organization can create a continuum of accessibility, and support the employment lifecycle from job seeking to job accommodation to career advancement.",

This is especially important when you have learners using assistive technologies, especially screen readers. \r\n\r\nAs a native screen reader user, I will share points in this session that are critical to designing online learning for screen reader users. I will also highlight how such design provides a \u201ccurb-cut\u201d advantage to all learners. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, learning technologies must work with screen readers. For that to happen those technologies must align with accessibility standards. This could also make these learning technologies more usable with other assistive technologies. \r\n\r\nNext, the learning materials must be created keeping non-visual access in mind. This requires that content creators are aware of the needs of screen reader users. If not, they would be introducing barriers to learning. \r\n\r\nFurther, the teaching practices must be inclusive. This involves making the curriculum, instruction, and assessment usable by learners with diverse needs. \r\n\r\nFinally, it will be easier for everyone if they work together as a community and learn from one another.\r\n\r\nIn summary, inclusive design of technology, content, pedagogy, and community is critical to making online learning accessible. Even if one of these components is not accessible, the learning experience will not be accessible.",

    "description": "Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in Canada with the risk of blindness being 25 times greater for individuals with diabetic retinopathy. Vision problems and blindness associated with diabetic retinopathy can be prevented or mitigated with the proper control of blood sugar and blood pressure, yet, established methods for measuring and mediating such physiological states have proved inaccessible for the visually impaired community. \r\nInsulin pump therapy is a type of diabetes treatment offering insulin infusions rather than multiple daily insulin injections. However, for individuals who are partially sighted, deafblind, or blind and live with diabetes, the features of an insulin pump have not been designed as universally accessible.Using an online survey, we next examined the accessibility barriers experienced by Canadians with sight loss and diabetes in use of insulin pump devices. Insulin pumps currently offered on the Canadian market are not accessible for those who are visually impaired. The majority of pump users require the assistance of sighted individuals to safely and adequately use their devices. This research identified many accessibility problems with current pumps such as a lack of haptic feedback (i.e. vibrations), a lack of tactile feedback (i.e. buttons designed for accessibility), and a lack of sufficient audio feedback and visual feedback. Our findings clearly highlight distress due to inaccessibility of these devices.",

However, some organizations and enterprises are not familiar with implementing these channels. They have difficulty developing a functioning and sustainable process to deliver information in whatever accessible format an end user requests.\r\n\r\nWaiting for captioning or descriptive audio to be added to an existing video, waiting for verification of said captioning and audio to make sure the interpretation is correct, or waiting for someone who knows ASL to interpret a conversation, all of which could take hours, days, or longer is not acceptable and can result in severe repercussions. To avoid this, measures must be implemented to ensure communication flows freely, accurately, and promptly.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will discuss how it is possible to build a cost-effective, successful, and viable system, delivering immediately accessible communication to whoever requests it on demand. For those familiar with science fiction, think of Star Trek\u2019s universal translator, but going even further, a translator that provides language interpretations and can deliver accessible and accurate forms of communication.",

Therefore, the text of each element the screen reader reads, as well as the element role and state information, are essential to understanding the context of each element.\n We recommend developers to use native controls instead of custom controls to implement accessibility. Nevertheless, custom controls are used for many reasons, and each platform provides its own API for implementing accessibility to these custom controls.\n In the case of web/iOS/flutter/react-native/android jetpack compose, changing or adding proper role or state is very easy and need just little code.\r\nHowever, with the android view system, changing accessibility role or state is not easy, because each custom controls need to implement AccessibilityDelegate, and we should override onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo to set or change role or state.\n So we created useful util class for android view system accessibility. Inside this class, there are most short code that change or set accessibility role, state with just one line.\r\n  Also we added some useful methods such as accessibilityValue, more short code for detecting TalkBack, and send accessibility focus with some delay.\r\n  Applying this will util class will significantly reduce development time for accessibility issues.\r\nSo I want to share this class and explain how to apply.",

    "description": "The presentation will introduce Taptilo K and its efficiency through a pilot project's result to teachers and organization officials. Taptilo K is a Perkins-styled keyboard that is affordable and efficient for the blind and visually impaired. OHFA Tech investigated a big gap in braille writing: the traditional writing method, and the braille notetaker. Students need to stick to the traditional braille writing method before getting the braille notetakers. To fill the gap, Taptilo K has been developed.\r\nThe Taptilo app could be connected with Taptilo K via Bluetooth. When the students or the teachers tap the content on the screen, the Taptilo app will read the word. The students can type it and check the answer by themselves. The app provides customized lessons so anyone can create a list so that personalized learning is available. \r\nTaptilo K will be developed as a braille keyboard so anyone can type braille and create a digital document. The documents made by Taptilo K will be able to be printed, shared through the app, or translated into printed letters.  \r\nTaptilo K is now on the pilot project that has proceeded in Jakarta, Indonesia with the public school for the blind. The project is provided by KOICA (Korea International Cooperation Agency). Students proceed with braille learning with Taptilo K and the app. After the class, the assignments are given via the app so the learning progress will be checked every month. The result gathered through 12 weeks also will be shown.\r\n\r\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.

For internet users with low vision or other impairments who rely on WCAG SC 1.4.8, SVGs offer a superior experience over JPEGs and PNGs. Part 1 of this session introduces how SVGs work with assistive technologies and scale beautifully, responding to dark mode, contrast themes, and screen sizes. SVGs are made from code, work in EPUB/native apps, load instantly (saving energy), and include descriptions, metadata, animation, and interactive features such as audio. \r\n\r\nPart 2: How to Write Artistic Alt Text for SVGs (Caroline)\r\n\r\nWe hear the same alt text tips again and again - keep it short, be specific, don\u2019t interpret. Many of these tips don\u2019t fit with describing works of art. Crafting artistic \u201ctext alternatives\u201d often means breaking rules. Part 2 explores how to write for the ears and imagination and deliver alt text users can feel and experience. Learn to take SVG alt text from basic to beautiful with a humanistic approach that breaks down the visual barriers to digital art.\r\n\r\nPart 3: Advantages of Accessible SVGs (Paul)\r\n\r\nAn SVG placed directly in a webpage\u2019s HTML code has more accessibility options than raster images which only have alt-text. SVGs have title and description elements and screen reader-friendly semantic HTML embedded directly in the file. Part 3 explains how to combine these elements with ARIA roles and attributes to expand the accessibility of smart SVGs.\r\n\r\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.

Interpreting certifications and requirements vary from state to state. Captioning technology (human/speech recognition/AI) is evolving and changing. How can decision-makers be expected to evaluate the qualifications of an interpreter or measure the accuracy of a captioner? It\u2019s an impossible task for so many professionals in a disabilities support role. With increased workloads and limited staffing, the challenges continue to grow. Being a subject matter expert in dozens of disabilities is almost impossible. Recognition is the first step! Sharing best practices for the Deaf and Hearing community will build a foundation for understanding how to best communicate. Sign language users often will nod their heads to indicate understanding of what is being said. This does not indicate they agree with what is being said. While this may seem basic, hearing people often make assumptions and are simply not equipped. Deaf people have their own culture that is different from the majority culture \u2014 that is, the hearing/speaking culture. Like other communities, differences in cultures can influence interactions and communication. Deaf, Deaf-Blind, and Hard of Hearing people, like any other population, are diverse in ethnicity, education, and backgrounds. There is not one-size-fits-all approach.",

Media can add variety & engagement, provide an example without needing an explanation, present massive amounts of information while making it easy to process, & more. But this is only true for those who can perceive the media. It is often difficult to determine which of an image's \"thousand words\" are what a learner needs to be on equal footing with their peers.\r\nUnfortunately, most a11y guidelines focus on images in informational online materials such as newspaper articles & standard websites or videos for entertainment. While the underlying principles defining good alt text & video descriptions are the same in an informational context & an educational one, there are also fundamental differences. What students get out of our media is critical. Informational density is higher. Cognitive load is a factor. Unpredictable questions come up in a classroom.

    "description": "A completely new approach for blind users to access web pages is presented. It uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to overcome the problems encountered by these users with conventional browsers and screen readers, particularly on an unfamiliar web site. Finding the location of key features, when accessing Internet web sites, is difficult and time consuming. This approach provides a method for finding active controls, and tracking and managing the results from invoking these controls. The new approach is called TAB: Task Aware Browsing, For a given vertical domain, e.g. shopping, travel, banking, etc., a set of keyboard commands is created that allow the user to perform the essential functions in that domain. The browser then uses a model generated from machine learning to convert each command into the appropriate actions for a learned web site. It filters the results of page updates to present the screen reader with only the essential portion of rendered page that is responsive to the command, eliminating excess clutter. Work performed to date indicates that machine learning techniques will allow this approach to work on a significant number of web sites. User testing demonstrates that it provides an appreciable improvement in the speed with which blind users can accomplish desired tasks.\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.

User interface designs for video components in signed languages are often built around - and limited by - text and audio conventions. Although there have been minor innovations in video-based interface designs, these efforts are hampered by the fact that existing video paradigms have not been developed for signed language-related usage nor the specific needs and shared conventions of the Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) signing community. When video-based components are built to deliver main content, navigation cues, and other UI elements in a visual language, many more possibilities need to be prototyped and explored. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will discuss previously unexplored possibilities for making video components more accessible, effective, and deliverable to Deaf ASL-signing people. We will demonstrate design options for key features of interfaces with video components. We will shed light on areas that have not been widely explored or considered in UX/UI accessibility, design, and development practices, and discuss how to create tools that facilitate authentic and meaningful interactions with Deaf SL users. \r\n\r\nOur goal is to broaden and shift attendee perspectives and offer new insights on novel signed language-centric video-based UX/UI designs that include and engage deaf signing communities in the world of online information.",

We view our inventions as a continual process rather than a finished product, and we want to lead viewers through this process so they can apply it to their own products.\r\n\r\n1. Function: \u00a0observing the needs of an individual lets us decide features necessary for an invention to be beneficial. We show working closely with wheelchair-users to design a wheelchair bag with customizable 8-strap system.\r\n\r\n2. Fashion:\u00a0 \u00a0considering aesthetics, a person\u2019s self-image, lifestyle and how they desire to be perceived by others is important. We show how development in mobility devices, fashion trends, and social perceptions challenged us to design our adaptable low-vison cross-body bag.\r\n\r\n3. Feedback-based research:\u00a0 \u00a0engaging with people who use the product in their daily lives informs us before, during and after the design process.\u00a0 We use an \u201copen-ended\u201d design model that constantly improves. We show how to apply feedback to improve a product through a step-by-step of how we developed our low-vision backpack system.\r\n\r\nWe conclude by challenging viewers to apply 3-F for better product development.",

Keeping designs simple and intuitive reduce issues with cognitive overload and anxiety triggers. When requiring a user to complete an action with a specific time limit provide easily accessible extensions. If at all possible, remove the time requirements as this benefits multiple groups of users. Provide multiple reminders for scheduled events. Providing these reminders makes it less likely a user will get distracted and miss important scheduled events. \r\nHow can we design to avoid common panic and anxiety triggers while providing meaningful access to the same information? Graphics and text descriptions of a graphic and disturbing nature are often integral to sharing the news of today and historical accounts. People with strong adverse reactions to certain topics should be given simple warnings of the content within so as to not accidentally trigger panic, anxiety or depressive symptoms. Providing general descriptors such as Trigger Warning *Suicide, *Sexual Assault *Serious Injuries etc. can help the user quickly and safely navigate away from or around the triggering content.",

    "description": "Learning to code is one of the most common curricula that have found its way into standard offerings throughout today\u2019s educational landscape.  Often these curricula are very visual in nature and students who are blind are unable to participate in this instruction.  From start to finish, this process can pose significant challenges to a blind student at all stages, from the initial concept learning phase, through the creation and reading of one\u2019s code, to the result being something that the student can meaningfully experience.\r\nWith the ever-growing technology space, the world of computing programming is in high demand with a shortage of programmers.  Having the right tools to assist the engagement level in the early stages of coding is essential in continuing the journey with what can become a successful career path and serve as a means to deplete the high unemployment rate for the visually impaired. \r\nThis presentation will demonstrate how one can use accessible tools to introduce a blind student to coding concepts through tactile pods and introduce methods by which students can easily transition to writing and editing code using a refreshable braille device.  This natural progression in the learning process will enable a student to create code whilst receiving both speech and braille feedback independently.",

This move means major changes for how braille and tactile graphics are created, delivered, and interacted with by users. This presentation will cover the work that needs to be done now to prepare for the future of digital tactile literacy. \r\n\r\nPart of this presentation will cover the efforts being undertaken to create a new electronic braille file standard currently called the eBRF. This international effort seeks to create a dynamic braille file standard that allows braille layouts to be manipulated, navigated, read, and shared across braille regions. It will also be configurable based on a user's needs and preferences. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will discuss the need for a new dynamic tactile graphics standard. Current standards that exist for tactile graphics are based on a static medium, and while they should serve as the basis for standards for the digital age, more clarification is needed. The tactile graphics of the future will be interactive, dynamic, and offer multimodal methods of learning. We need standards so that students are prepared to interact with the graphics regardless of the hardware that they are using. \r\n\r\nFinally, this presentation will cover other challenges and opportunities that face the future of digital tactile literacy. We will also discuss new ways of distributing braille and tactile graphics and how these distribution methods will lead to decreased costs and delivery times.",

    "description": "We developed a 90-minute interactive web-based multiplayer game for all our 350,000+ people across 150+ countries. The game required teams to travel by a virtual elevator and complete interactive quizzes, participate in discussions, and score points for the leader board. By deploying a shift-left strategy, accessibility was factored as a non-negotiable requirement into all stages of the game development process including planning, concepting, design, front end development, testing, and release. WCAG criteria were mapped against the scope of the game play and of particular importance were requirements related to keyboard access, semantics, color contrast, captioning, audio descriptions, timed events, forms, and page titles. The developers evaluated the technology stack for optimal accessibility including accessibility API mappings, user agent behavior, and assistive technologies adaptation. Iterative game design sessions were conducted with the UX design team and developers utilized specific HTML, CSS, and ARIA elements to optimize accessibility. They also ensured the usage of accessible media players, and provided easy access to closed captions, audio descriptions, and microphone hints. We used an enhanced Trusted Tester methodology to test and report accessibility bugs, and leveraged the report for remediation tracking. By fully embedding accessibility we were able to successfully deliver an inclusive enterprise gaming experience.",

However, most studies focus only on the technological aspects and lack users' perspectives [Jung Woo et al. (2018), and B.K.Sovacool, et al.(2020)]. In Japan, people over 65 years old are about 30% of the population. Life support for senior citizens is urgent, and smart homes are expected as one way to support their independent living. In this study, the authors propose new models of smart homes for senior citizens based on the user survey.\r\n\r\nSurvey:\r\nThe authors have individually interviewed 39 senior citizens so far. The highest scoring feature was an automatic emergency notification, rated positively by 33 respondents. Telemedicine and home appliance hazard notifications followed. Respondents cited concerns about their future physical or mental changes. In contrast, features related to crime prevention scored lower, and they cited the community's security and the fact that those features are already installed in apartments. On the other hand, positive and negative responses were evenly split on health management systems and life monitoring sensors. Those who approve seek a more convenient life and peace of mind, and hostile voters tend to resist automation and monitoring.\r\n\r\nPresentation:\r\nThe interview survey is ongoing. At CSUN2023, the authors will report the details, including the results, and propose smart home models to help the independent living of senior citizens.",

As this trend continues there is a growing relationship between the following concepts:\r\n\r\n-\tThe promise of the business opportunity mobile applications present.\r\n-\tMobile devices finding their way to late adopters, particularly older generations.\r\n-\tUsers with cognitive conditions finding comfort in the Simplicity of Native.\r\n-\tDeveloping applications that respect platform Accessibility Configurations.\r\n\r\nIt is in the overlap of these concepts that truly successful Native Applications reside. How do we leverage these concepts to make our users, and in turn our business, more successful? The answer comes down to one thing Native Mobile Applications must have to be successful:\r\n\r\n-\tConceptual Integrity.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I will walk attendees through the various breakdowns that a lack of conceptual integrity leads to within Native Mobile Design including structural issues, user confusion, and basic misuse of platform APIs. We will discuss the concept of the limited space of Native Mobile devices and how it forces us to design more simply. Relating it back to how a lack of Conceptual Integrity prevents us from leveraging the simplicity of Mobile Design and therefore failing to leverage the business value of Mobile.",

Macmillan Learning and its partners incorporated accessibility principles and approaches into the development from the beginning to ensure all students can utilize the tool and complete virtual experiments. The first version of the software was released in 2020, and has been used in high school and higher education courses to familiarize learners with a lab environment, lab procedures, tools, experiments, and outcomes. Continued development has aimed to expand the content and improve the user experience and accessibility of the software, with version 2.0 going live in the fall of 22.\r\nWe will examine challenges in making a highly visual and dynamic web environment accessible, and demonstrate solutions that were employed. We will focus on specific accessibility features and enhancements that have been added over the past two years, including enhancements to \u201cdrag and drop\u201d functionality and the dissemination of color information to users in situations where dynamic color changes are possible . We will also address methods used to communicate the existence and extent of accessibility features to potential users, and challenges that arise when they assume this type of software is inaccessible.",

From this basis, the discussion will evolve to tools that can support the learner across the curriculum, from basic reading, writing, and math to higher levels of STEM and research. In addition, attention will be given to specific low vision supports delivered by Connect 12\u2019s Prodigi software and online productivity tools like the Google Suite, Microsoft Teams, and other applications that can help learners of all ages. Throughout, participants will engage in a discussion of how the available features and tools can be used flexibly to meet a variety of learner needs, in addition to supporting remote or distance learning. While supporting individuals holistically with any assistive device will never be as easy as A-B-C or 1-2-3,  this presentation will highlight how it is possible to support learning wherever it needs to happen and to include everyone in a manner that respects their individual needs.\r\n\r\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.

Section 508 conformance testing of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is currently subjective, and test results are dependent on who (or what) is doing the conformance testing. While the standards are defined, interpretation of the standards vary. There are many tools, but each tool maker has their own interpretation of the standards and what it means to meet requirements. Federal agencies use a wide range of disparate testing methods to validate conformance to IT accessibility requirements. This difference in testing leads to:\r\n- Duplication of effort across agencies,\r\n- Inability to share and rely on validation testing results from other agencies\r\n- Confusion among IT product vendors when test results, methodologies, and requirements from agencies conflict with one another.\r\n\r\nSection 508 applies to ICT developed, procured, maintained, or used by federal agencies. Inconsistent conformance testing by agencies and industry affect procurement decisions and internal product release decisions. The goal of the ICT Testing Baselines is to ensure consistent and accurate Section 508 conformance testing by establishing standard requirements of testing methodologies used by federal agencies.",

A growing concern is the accessibility of digital graphics, especially in education, for individuals with blindness and low vision. As education continues to shift further into the digital space, many students are struggling with learning how to parse and understand the rich, information-dense graphical landscape, such as charts and diagrams, when they are presented digitally.\r\n\r\nTouchscreens, which utilize haptic, audio, visual, and kinesthetic feedback, have great potential to help close the gap in accessible, digital graphics. The ability to render graphics with tones, description, vibration, and magnified visuals makes the touchscreen an incredibly inclusive and versatile tool to leverage in education. In our work, we have investigated the presentation of digital STEM graphics rendered in this multimodal way, highlighting the promise of haptic feedback as a means to facilitate and scaffold deeper understanding of charts and diagrams.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will review our research and findings, which have been used to create a set of design guidelines for generating basic elements of touchscreen-based multimodal graphics. We will then demonstrate how to render graphics using these guidelines. After demonstrating how the graphics were made and how they work, we will encourage the audience to explore the graphics, share their thoughts, and offer feedback for guiding future development.",

Norbert Rum setup and built out one of the largest blind communities on the internet using reddit called /r/blind, which has over 18,000 users and over 400,000 impressions a month. The community provides many examples of what the visually impaired have to deal with on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nWhen WebAIM started providing surveys from screen-reader communities covering web use and technology, it helped build awareness to the advocates and developers trying to improve accessibility. During the last couple years, the reddit community noticed that the reports have a smaller sample size, which creates potential result biases towards advanced users and select geolocations. This is not to diminish the work done, because it still provides light to a generally unrecognized population.\r\n \r\nAfter discussion with the reddit community and various leaders in the accessibility space, we are expanding surveys to a larger audience with a wider level of visual impairments. We are tapping into the expansive reddit user base and further connections into other digital communities. The survey\u2019s flow paths help better account for the different scenarios and combinations of users and impairments, such as levels of magnification and devices used.

In this session, we will take a closer look at the general responsibilities of a product manager to make the software inclusive for everyone, regardless of their disabilities. \r\nAwareness: \r\nA product manager should have the ability to understand the impact of the product on a wide range of people\u2019s needs, especially people with disabilities. To gain this knowledge, if the product exists, test with people with disabilities to understand their challenges. If the product is brand new, plan to include guidelines and best practices. WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). \r\nMake time:\r\nIt\u2019s important to reserve time in each sprint to design, develop and test for the accessibility requirements. The early process helps to reduce the cost of fixing bugs after the deployment. Include accessibility requirements in the sprint planning to account for the requirements. Include accessibility as part of the user stories or write a separate user story for accessibility. \r\nSkill up the team:\r\nEnable the team members to gain knowledge of accessibility guidelines and the needs of people with disabilities. Encourage certifications.\r\nDefinition of Done:\r\nAccessibility should be part of the testing and deployment process. The automated test covers 30 to 40% of WCAG. Plan for manual test and usability test. \r\nContinuous focus:\r\nAccessibility is not a one-time implementation or afterthought. It\u2019s a continuous process.",

They have difficulty determining the best route for making their content accessible. They are dealing with meeting compliance requirements with which they are unfamiliar, and it is difficult for them to ascertain what tools to use, especially when they have different types of documents that could be coming from other sources. Taking this on can be daunting for any organization, but it can be incredibly intimidating if they are not experts at document accessibility. However, it doesn\u2019t have to be, especially when using the right tools.\r\n\r\nThis session will explore and compare two tools for manual remediation, both GUI based and one using AI/Computer learning for effective auto-tagging. We will show how these two tools work, demonstrating the two approaches and how there can be instances where a combination of automation and manual processing could be the most effective.\r\n\r\nDuring this session, there will be a demonstration of the two tools being used for remediation. There will also be a comparison of both tools, using the same document to determine the easiest and most efficient in creating not only accessible PDF but also compliant and usable.\r\n\r\nAfter remediation is complete, the last step will be testing the output to ensure the final PDF is WCAG, PDF/UA, and HHS compliant.",

While the ultimate \u201cshift-left\u201d within this lifecycle would be to the project manager or product owner, design is where accessibility can become more heavily involved, in providing feedback, guidance, and education.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a significant opportunity to \u201cshift-left\u201d on another trajectory \u2013 design education itself. In our experience, designers\u2019 knowledge of accessibility varies substantially, and ranges from those with some knowledge \u2013 to those who, for the most part, would consider themselves very unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nAs the European digital accessibility landscape begins to take shape from a legal perspective, with the EU Web Directive now live and EU Accessibility Act coming, the Optum Accessibility Center of Excellence team based in Ireland felt it presented an opportunity to reach out and connect with universities here that offer design and user experience-related courses. \r\n\r\nThis presentation will outline the journey we are taking in Ireland as we aim to \u201cshift-left\u201d from an accessibility perspective within the discipline of design education, highlight the outreach work we are doing with universities, discuss why now is the perfect time to do this from a European perspective, as well as show how this model could be scalable in any country.",

    "description": "A growing number of studies conducted in various countries shed light on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students with disabilities. In this session, we shall attempt to add some insight to the issue based on the situation in Japan.\n We have conducted a number of studies on students and teachers with disabilities in Japan to see how they are affected by the pandemic. Firstly, we evaluated the accessibility of four different Leaning Management Systems used in the country and demonstrated that the systems made in Japan are not made to ensure accessibility at all. Also, neither teachers nor students with disabilities consult the Disability Resource Offices regarding assistive technology. Nevertheless, skilled users of assistive technology who are well accustomed to the existence of barriers were able to use the Japanese-made, inaccessible Leaning Management Systems. We have also found that some Japanese universities customized accessible open-source Learning Management Systems in a way that hindered their accessibility. An interesting point we stumbled upon is that the opinion on Leaning Management Systems varied depending on the age and the position of the persons surveyed.\n To see these points in perspective, we reviewed the nationwide surveys conducted in Japan and compared them to the surveys done in the U.S. during the same period. From the Japan-U.S. comparison, we derived that digital accessibility is truly an enormous problem in Japan.\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.

Kind of like being provided with glasses that are not your prescription and having to study, or work, or take a test with those.\r\nWith Assistive Technology on Demand \u2013 a new service being introduced by non-profit Raising the Floor which works in conjunction with the *free* Morphic program \u2013 AT users can now have their assistive technologies show up on any computers they need to use \u2013 and have the AT configured just as they need it.  This can be computers at school, libraries, community centers, testing centers, or family members (grandma, cousins etc.), any computer that has the free Morphic program installed on it.  Currently Morphic is being installed on shared computers at major universities, library systems, disability organizations, clinical and rehabilitation programs across the country.  Our program is looking for additional sites and systems to help further deploy, explore, and continually improve the service. We will present and demonstrate it here as well as seek feedback during session. Then invite them to exhibit hall to try.",

Using a mixed methodology including: a literature review, a policy scan, survey analysis and key informant interviews identify three key issues. These are that course content and designers need to understand accessibility needs of learners, rigid evaluation frameworks and lack of instructor training with OLMS can create barriers for students with disabilities. \r\nIn a national survey of student experiences note the lack adequate support, with course materials arriving 2 to 3 weeks late. Many students' responses also explain the general inaccessibility of their coursework, including textbooks, online articles, and classroom. At the K-12 level, every school board has an accessibility policy regarding the goals and guidelines they have in place for ensuring equal access to education for all their students. Many school board policies discuss accessible materials and formats but not specifically in an online learning framework. In summary, the online learning environments in Canadian K-12 and postsecondary education during COVID-19 were sometimes difficult to navigate. Integrated approaches to improve accessibility of online learning will improve the \u201cfuture state\u201d for students with disabilities.",

Lessons learned and innovations in this talk come from IBM\u2019s own journey over the last several years to have accessibility issues fixed earlier in the product\u2019s life cycle and from moving accessibility into the design phase. By leveraging IBM Design Thinking, open-sourcing its software tools, expanding the frameworks and browser coverage, improving automation, increasing comprehensive rules, and by focusing on the end user, we have done exactly that. \r\n\r\nThe open-source code hosted on GitHub was used to re-develop the entire suite of accessibility software tools. With support for both Chrome and Firefox, development operations with Karma and NodeJS modules, and expanding to include Cypress, and testing frameworks such as Selenium and Jest. We have been successful in seeing adoption of these tools with over 13,000 active users in the Chrome and Firefox stores.\r\n\r\nOur users are now more efficiently able to design (prevent issues), quickly identify accessibility issues, more effectively tackle accessibility problems, and more easily report to stakeholders. User feedback over the last couple years from the freely available tools has led to improvements that will be highlighted in this talk.",

However very little work has been done towards making critical preparation materials accessible. BVI students do not get enough preparation materials as their sighted peers (e.g., free SAT samples, apps), which puts them at a significant disadvantage in preparing for these competitive exams. To bridge this access gap, we have developed a novel AI-powered system, Yebi, that converts visual SAT samples into accessible output formats for: (1) Braille and tactile graphics, (2) screenreaders, (3) multisensory digital access on Yebi app, (4) Braille readers, and (5) audio devices. This first-of-its-kind system not only dynamically creates accessible version of SATs but do so in an intuitive way such that: (1) the graphics are optimized based on BANA guidelines for tactile rendering via embossers, (2) the graphics on the Yebi app support interactivity via audio-tactile feedback on smartphones, (3) the math expressions on audio output are delivered as spoken math as it would be read by an experienced narrator, (4) math via tactile output is supported for both Nemeth and UEB. Furthermore, the system also provides tools and mechanisms for editing, modifying, and previewing the contents prior to downloading them. Initial evaluations with expert transcribers indicated significant time savings and efficiency in authoring accessible SAT samples.",

    "description": "The University of Washington has collaborated with many software companies to help them to incorporate accessibility in their development process. In this session, UW accessibility experts will share their journeys to accessibility of Workday, ServiceNow, Zoom and how they incorporated accessibility throughout their development processes.\r\n\r\nMany companies are trying hard to make more accessible software, however their designers and developers rarely have formal education and training in accessibility principles. Companies typically have well-established processes for software design and development, but lack a cohesive approach to ensuring accessibility for their products essential workflows.\r\n\r\nIncorporating non-familiar accessibility concepts in the software development process can be a challenge for companies that lack this experience. While all companies have their own software development processes, they are unique in their approaches and these can\u2019t be easily copied from one company to another. There are, however, commonalities that can be used to help companies develop their own recipe for accessibility success. Most of these companies have separate design, developer and QA/QE teams and while there is often some communication between these teams, we often observe that there is no effective communication between them regarding accessibility. This can produce islands of accessibility but neglects to provide a homogenous functional accessibility throughout the product.",

    "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic had significant impacts on the employment rate and employment experiences of people with disabilities. Through a series of studies during the pandemic, CNIB Research undertook an analysis of the impact of the pandemic on the lived experiences of people who are blind and partially sighted in Canada. From these studies, we identified that the employment rates of working age Canadians with sight loss had decreased significantly during the early months of the pandemic. While these rates have since rebounded, we became interested in understanding the current employment experiences of working-age adults with sight loss in Canada, as compared to our previous studies conducted in 2018 and 2019. While a number of metrics of employment had not significantly changed during the pandemic, when we compared the results of the 2018, 2019 and 2021 studies, we identified that there were decreases in the proportion of people working full-time; increases in the number of people working from home; increased reliance on technology and accessible technology training; and, qualitative changes to the work experience. The ongoing integration between technology and the workplace is a trend that must be continually monitored in a post-pandemic work world, and will play an important role in the future of work for blind or partially sighted adults.",

An audio describer attended rehearsals for each production, met with the stage director, actors, the designers (scenic, costumes, lighting, sound) and developed an audio description script throughout the three-week rehearsal period. The script was then available for that same describer to voice at every performance beginning with opening night and with, of course, an eye on stage action as minor changes in action could occur from performance to performance. The arrangement had two benefits: more time was available to carefully observe the theatrical process and construct descriptive language that was more thorough and considered; and people desiring the service could attend any performance with no advance notice and be assured of access to the visual aspects of the production. Other innovations included Braille and large-print programs, models of the set and props in the lobby, and a tactile \u201cscrapbook\u201d of costume pieces.

Teams can set up Quality Assurance (QA) processes in place for carrying out this task.\r\n\r\nGuideline 4: User research - Even after testing it thoroughly in-house and making sure the app is accessible, gathering user feedback in a smaller group testing can help polish the product even further. When a user uses the app in real-time, you can clearly see how easy or hard it is for the user to access the app and the feature.\r\n\r\nGuideline 5: Addressing defects and user feedback - Once we gather enough feedback from the users to act on, the team must work on addressing those issues and release new app updates with the fixes for the user.

The lack of digital accessibility is also exasperated by the aging population that is increasing rapidly in so many countries.

As the need for building digital accessibility is highlighted in various ways, for many there is still a myth and a fear of how it can or should be incorporated in a product\u2019s design and development life cycle (DLC). In addition, the current Usability Testing methods and approaches have not evolved to meet the needs, or satisfy all users. \r\nThe management of many organizations still refer to accessibility testing as optional requirements and not necessary for the success of their products. Thus, contributing to the rapid increase of their own technical debts, and failure of their products.\r\nWhen the objectives of usability testing and accessibility testing are compared, they are not separate entities. In fact, they are one and the same. Without the digital accessibility requirements, the usability testers are not mindful of the needs and are not testing for all aspects of a product, with all types of test subjects. This is often based on lack of knowledge and empathy, as well as organizational mandates. So, the testing is incomplete.\r\nExperience Study offers a wholistic evaluation and testing approach throughout the product DLC.",

    "description": "Today\u2019s students are starting to learn computer coding concepts as early as pre-school. With the ubiquitous availability of mobile devices and tablets, tools for younger students to begin playing with coding concepts have become easier to acquire. Whether a student downloads a mobile app, accesses a web coding game, or participates in an online simulation, there are options available for any level of coding. \r\n\r\nHowever, for students who are blind or have low vision, such coding tools are less available. Often the apps used by their sighted classmates are inaccessible or concepts are challenging to understand. \r\n\r\nThis session will discuss new features, including the CJ Puzzles and coding module. It will also demonstrate how APH has made coding tools accessible. We will also discuss careers in technology and the importance of teaching coding concepts from an early age.  \r\n\r\nOver the past several years, the American Printing House for The Blind (APH) has been developing a roadmap of accessible coding tools meant to mirror the tools used by sighted students. If the tools used by the rest of the class could not be made accessible, APH has also created complementary tools which often use physical objects to solidify coding concepts for the student with visual impairments. From accessible apps to physical engineering and robotics kits, APH\u2019s goal is to provide tools to enable students of all ages with visual impairments to obtain necessary coding skills alongside their sighted classmate",

This benefits their customers, employees and other stakeholders.\r\nIntopia typically undertakes a gap analysis which empowers organisations to move from where they currently sit on the digital accessibility continuum to where they wish to be over time.\r\nThis presentation will outline the components of that gap analysis. We will explain the value and content of stakeholder interviews, reviews of strategic documentation such as policies, plans and processes as well as samples of comms and website content.\r\nWe will discuss the structure of a report, talk about risk assessment and recommendations designed to meet the specific needs of an individual organisation. We will also discuss additional information which can help organisations, such as suggested improvements to existing policies, checklists and resources they can use to follow up the learnings from the report.\r\nThe presentation will conclude with thoughts as to what organisations can do with respect to next steps once they have received a gap analysis and how they can put in place a plan to become more mature with respect to digital accessibility. This will include tips on ensuring that motivation remains high and progress is institutionalised so that it survives changes in personnel.",

Student workers and investing in a few updated products helped make this happen. When the pandemic came along, we were able to use some of the same work flows and existing students workers to assist faculty in captioning recorded lectures for their online courses.

    "description": "Because of the recent pandemic, students across the nation were forced to participate in school virtually.  The unusual stress forced upon the students, as well as others living in their homes, was evident upon the return to a traditional school model.  Reports of students\u2019 perceived trauma during this time resulted in a noticeable increase in disruptive behavior.  Students attempted to deal with a heightened sense of threat based on learned fear and isolation by using physical movement, sounds, and other behaviors that were disruptive to learning.\r\n\r\nTo address this new phenomenon, classrooms in Kentucky began implementing sensory rooms and sensory spaces.  Trainings across the state ensued, instructing educators on identifying sensory processing disorders and strategies to regulate and maintain homeostasis within the student.  With this emphasis, a new strategy emerged for classroom management that uses Universal Design for Learning (UDL). This innovative approach includes reading, writing, and math instruction with sensory components embedded throughout the instructional day.  This integration of sensory regulation and academic instruction uses sensory tool kits and techniques that are good for teaching all students, but absolutely essential for students that experienced trauma.  This new approach to sensory needs and disruptive behavior reduction is OARS (Optimal Arousal Reading-Writing-Math Strategies).",

We advocate a shift-left strategy to integrate accessibility throughout the product development process and this includes embedding accessibility resources in the project team. When embedded, the accessibility resource conducts in-sprint testing, reviews UX designs, creates user stories, and provides guidance to UX designers, front end developers, testers, and product owners at the appropriate phases to ensure accessible product delivery. When requested to perform accessibility audits, the audit is tailored based on phase, delivery timeline, and budget and we offer three types of audits \u2013 accessibility basic check, mini-audit, and full audit. We have created a bespoke testing methodology using the Trusted Tester methodology as the starting point but enhanced it to cover test cases related to screen readers, code scanners, contrast checkers, and other testing tools. To make accessibility easily actionable to front end developers and UX designers, we aggregated all WCAG A and AA criteria and created 12 high-level accessibility non-functional requirements. We have also developed an in-house automation tool that leverages open-source tools, performs screen reader automation, and improves our testing efficiency.",

During the first two years of this Program, we have been successful in generating a grassroots service delivery model, working with key campus partners to test their web assets for accessibility and assistive technology compatibility and to educate them about digital accessibility and quality assurance.  To date, the team has worked to test and provide feedback on 10+ institutional web projects, over half of which were strategically aligned with institutional priorities or will have a high impact on campus life for equity-deserving community members. The completion of these projects has also led to the creation of trainings and templates that can be implemented in future programs.",

    "description": "Autistic individuals face poor employment outcomes relative to their neurotypical peers, with studies estimating that 50%-75% of autistic adults are unemployed or underemployed in the United States. Poor employment outcomes result in a greater need for financial and social support. Although there have been many strides in developing interventions for autistic children, there remains a gap in addressing employment challenges faced by autistic young adults entering the workforce. Soft skills, such as communication and teamwork, are not easily quantifiable, but can be practiced and improved upon. However, many of the resources available for soft skill training, such as job coaching and manualized curriculums, are expensive and not individualized. 3D simulated environments made in virtual reality can address these limitations by providing varied and individualized soft skill development systems. Our presentation will provide an overview of virtual reality and how it has been used for both hard and soft skill development. We will then present two virtual reality systems that we have developed for job interview training and teamwork skills practice. Both systems are developed to provide training to the autistic individual while also providing meaningful feedback to employers on how they can adapt their practices to improve employment outcomes. The presentation will conclude with a discussion on potential further applications of VR and current barriers.",

    "description": "Digital accessible non-visual maps have traditionally been described through alternate text, presented in a table, presented as a list of nearby locations to an address, or given as turn-by-turn directions. The problem with these methods is geographic information (the main content of the map) is completely lacking or significantly diminished in these methods. For instance, users can't answer \"What clockface direction is the entrance from the elevator?\" Audiom is a digital web-based non-visual  map viewer that can accurately represent dynamic  geographic/spatial information non-visually. Audiom can be embedded next to an existing visual map on any app or website, and in many cases use the same data source as the visual map. The Audiom interface is a text-based and auditory virtual reality interface only requiring headphones to view. The user can move an avatar using a gesture e.g., up arrow to move north or left arrow to move west a user-defined distance, and can hear sounds representing different objects on the map through 3D audio. The process for obtaining an Audiom map is: 1) Work with the Audiom team to process the data to make sure it contains the required elements; 2) Get the data into Audiom through the Audiom server or passing it to the embedded map; and 3) View and test the map in your site/app. Audiom can currently represent any outdoor space e.g, neighborhoods, parks, campuses, transit routes, and building complexes.",

Since the built environment is designed for those with vision, both indoor and outdoor environments contain a well-organized set of printed or icon-based signs to aid in navigation. Print signage is, of course, not accessible to people who are blind. Fortunately, improvements in accessible outdoor navigation became more accessible with the development of GPS devices starting in 2000 and with the introduction of several accessible iPhone and Android apps in the past few years. Unfortunately, GPS signals are blocked inside large buildings, such as airports, sports arenas, shopping malls, and the like, leaving people who are blind or visually impaired without any non-visual options for indoor navigation where there is no GPS.",

Our premise is that such programs may be sacrificing maximum student outcomes for the sake of program efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this presentation is to reacquaint professionals with the value of meeting with students on an individual level in order to best determine their needs and help them achieve their goals. Our aim is to encourage intake appointments, live training sessions, and follow-up assessments rather than relying on automated systems or tutorial videos that allow such encounters to become secondary. We also want to encourage programs to apply unique rather than one-size-fits-all solutions -- a concept that can work alongside, rather than instead of, Universal Design. Examples involving assistive technology and alternate media services (the presenters' fields of expertise) will serve as proxies for services in general.\r\n\r\nOverall, this session is meant to motivate DSPS staff to work more closely with the students we serve, and to remind us of why we do what we do. It will be designed to promote discussion, share ideas, and spark innovation. It's about thinking outside of the box by going back to our roots.\r\n\r\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.

The UDC partnered with the project co-sponsors and their vendors on the accessibility requirements for this project.\r\nIn this session, UDC team members will explain our approach to this project, the steps we took to ensure the new web presence was accessible, and lessons learned.\r\nAccessibility is a shared commitment as CSUN, and the project sponsors included it as a requirement beginning with the vendor selection process. Still, garnering explicit executive support was a critical first step. Throughout the project, we advocated for accessibility in planning and goal-setting.\r\nThe UDC team gave feedback on early designs, tested prototypes, then tested pre-production pages. We'll describe our testing methodologies in detail.\r\nTraining editors is vital so that content meets accessibility guidelines.

What data links to WCAG can companies quantify? How can product owners easily understand which issues have the highest priority? \r\n\r\nIn February 2021, from what started as a response to product owners' frustrations, I created the VMware Accessibility Successes (VASes). Now, in 2023, this has proved to be a data-driven foundation for:\r\n- creating a baseline for success measures aligning to WCAG 2.1.\r\n- scoring metrics in line with existing ticketing workflow practices, allowing product managers to prioritize bugs easily and remediate products quickly.\r\n- a product dashboard where senior leadership can track progress.\r\n- creating a score that not only recognizes areas products can improve but also recognizes their success.\r\n\r\nJoin this exploration into how data-driven metrics were born at VMware and learn how you can use a similar approach for your organization.",

A major barrier is the lack of an adequate, two-way method for getting math equations to and from a refreshable braille display. NWEA, a research and educational services nonprofit, in collaboration with Perkins Access, is making middle school math assessments more accessible for BVI students using AI. With AI data analysis, patterns in online math tests and their barriers have been identified in this project, which was awarded a grant by Microsoft\u2019s AI for Accessibility program. Prototype math questions that address the identified barriers were created to meet accommodation needs that otherwise would exclude students with disabilities from higher-level mathematics as well as paths to advanced degrees and STEM-related careers. Process-driven math was integrated into the prototype to simplify the landscape of complex algebraic expressions and reduce the cognitive load on working memory. Equation prototypes were developed to allow screen reader users to select various parts of a mathematics equation and drill into the parts they want to explore. Learn about the revolutionary research, prototypes, their reception by students and teachers and the continued effort to create efficient, navigable math equations for multiple AT devices and inputs, including Nemeth, UEB and voice.",

Inclusive Job Descriptions - Be sure to have one that speaks to diverse applicants while being specific about the skillset. Do not include terms or content specific to gender, background, disability or status. Lay the groundwork for a more inclusive workspace.\r\n2. Where to recruit/who should do the recruiting - Ensuring there is diversity in the panelists that conduct the interview. Also, educating panelists to counter \u201cjust like me\u201d bias. \r\n3. The interview process should select questions that focus on talent and not abilities. \r\n4. Offer internships and coops to targeted groups of people. This is a great way to encourage candidates to join the team and ensure diversity.\r\n5. Partner with third party organizations who can help find talent from diverse groups and ensure that we offer opportunities to all, irrespective of their background, race, gender, disability.\r\n6.

However, the same student evaluation process is not used for staff of disability centers. These staff are evaluated only by their disability center directors.  Once a year, some registered students with disabilities at many universities provide feedback in satisfaction surveys that include their general assessment of disability center services.  Unfortunately, this disability center feedback does not include student satisfaction with the disability staff member who was assigned to assist them.  Relevant data from one large university disability center (which registers thousands of students) were analyzed in ongoing student surveys.  In addition to an assessment of student satisfaction with specific staff, the analysis of the surveys provides direct feedback on whether the student\u2019s expressed disability needs were met.   The surveys had linked information which included: student enrollment status (e.g., full-time status), demographic variables (e.g., gender), academic variables (e.g., major), and center variables (e.g., the general reason for the meeting with the staff member).  Overall, a detailed evaluation of disability center staff by the students they assist is clearly necessary to accurately assess the overall quality and effectiveness of individual service providers.",

    "description": "PDF files have been around longer than widespread use of the internet. Although some in the accessibility community treat PDFs as a \"stepchild,\" technology advances suggest they are not going away and may even become more complex. HTML may rule supreme, but if a person wants to download and store a bunch of statements, they're usually going to prefer saving them as PDF files.\n Most accessibility professionals are familiar with PDFs created by people using desktop apps. These PDFs or their source documents can be fixed manually. But what do you do when a PDF is generated on demand? Think of every receipt, credit card, bank, sales, inventory, or invoicing statement you have ever downloaded. The method used to generate the PDFs matters. Many server-based tools can create PDFs, but the majority can't produce accessible PDFs even if the source HTML they are based on is accessible.\n In the meantime, PDFs have developed a bad reputation among many screen reader users because millions--if not trillions--of PDFs on the internet today are not accessible. If your organization allows people to generate PDFs on demand, the problem grows exponentially. \n The speaker has been manually fixing PDFs for accessibility since 2006\u2014about as long as PDF tags have existed. Now in the financial sector, he has worked with developer teams to improve accessibility of on-demand PDFs. He will review the history of PDFs, the PDF/UA standard, and some good and bad methods for creating machine generated PDFs.\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.

While we recognize the WCAG as a powerful resource, we believe it is a baseline for us to approach our solutions and for us to build accessible experiences that meet our users' needs, we need all those inputs to get it right.  \r\n\r\nOur process aims to go beyond usability and ensure that our products are positive experiences for those using them. From early conception of a product or feature to its delivery, we identify and learn what barriers are there around accessibility for our users and those insights shape our solution.

    "description": "Addressing the pandemic\u2019s consequences is ongoing. But one aspect from millions of students being forced to do everything online gives us a real opportunity: to rethink the definitions and roles of \u201cassistive technology\u201d in the classroom.\r\n\r\nEven before the pandemic there were signs of change \u2013 districts were buying products traditionally used by students with disabilities for all their learners. The continued influence of universal design for learning, combined with unexpectedly having to use technology for most activities, added momentum.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of broadly integrating assistive technology without the need for traditional processes for every use case could have a major impact in education. In this session we will discuss the:\r\n\r\n\u2022  Market dynamics fueling his change\r\n\u2022  Types of products becoming more mainstream\r\n\u2022  Benefits of removing the stigma of using AT\r\n\u2022  Potential barriers from \u201cold school\u201d IEP and 504 thinking\r\n\u2022  Evolving expectations for digital educational materials\r\n\u2022  Imperative of ensuring those who need AT the most aren\u2019t left further behind.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the newest cohort \u2013 dubbed \u201cGeneration Alpha\u201d \u2013 will be the first born totally in the 21st century and will be in front of screens for so much of their lives that some are referring to them as \u201cGeneration Glass.\u201d Given that future, it is critical that we reevaluate the role AT can play in supporting learning not just in school, but also for learning during the rest of their lives.",

    "description": "Hidden disabilities are medical conditions that are not noticeable or identifiable at first glance and may include autoimmune disorders, mental health conditions, and organ system dysfunction. Employers often question the value of accommodating employees with hidden disabilities.  \r\nEmployees with hidden disabilities who request accommodations should be treated with the same respect and due diligence as those with apparent disabilities. Approaching the interactive process objectively leads to effective accommodation outcomes by clarifying employee needs while maintaining employer requirements. \r\nWhile selecting accommodations, tools, and strategies that the individual has successfully and comfortably used previously may serve as a starting point, engaging resources to enhance the interactive process may generate additional options and optimize effective outcomes.  \r\nPresenters will discuss case study examples that implement a range of mainstream and traditional assistive technologies as well as resources to assist with navigating the interactive process. Cost benefit data will be provided as available. \r\nEffective assistive technology (AT) accommodations benefit employees with hidden disabilities by promoting equity and inclusion while maximizing productivity, morale, and workplace safety. A robust interactive process allows consideration of a range of accommodation options and balances individual preferences with employer priorities to optimize effectiveness.",

    "description": "Everyday work has shifted to a remote setting and employees with disabilities face unique challenges in receiving training, participating in meetings, communicating with colleagues and collaborating on team projects. Many employees with disabilities are finding the process to access remote meetings and the materials presented to be cumbersome and at times inaccessible.  Employers sometimes are uncertain of how to modify their processes to ensure all employees have equal access to all meetings.  Furthermore, specific challenges arise when an employee needs remote training on the Assistive Technology they use in the context of their work applications.  A variety of processes are needed to ensure the employee receives competent training and the AT trainer has sufficient remote access to the employee\u2019s workstation.  \r\n\r\nTCS Access\u2019 Senior Assistive Technology Specialist, Ben Soto and Harris Rosensweig, Director of Accessibility will provide best practices and real-world examples of how to maximize equal access for employees with disabilities who are now working remotely and need to engage in remote meetings and obtain remote training. This webinar is ideal for those who manage reasonable accommodations or assistive technology services and employees with disabilities and assistive technology users.\r\n\r\nThis Presentation Link is provided by the Presenter(s) and not hosted by the Center on Disabilities at CSUN.
